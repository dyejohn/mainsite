                description: "This case involved the Judiciary Act of 1789.

A slave, who was brought by his owner into free territories and back to Missouri, a slave state, sued claiming that his time living in free territory made him free. The court declared that the relevant parts of the Missouri Compromise were unconstitutional, and that he remained a slave as a result."

Therefore, the civil liberties and civil rights listed in the Bill of Rights were only protected under the Federal Government’s laws and actions; not by state governments. Because of the Supreme Court not applying the Bill of Rights to state laws and actions, the 14th Amendment was passed later so that the constitution did apply standards of equal protection and due process to state government laws."

                description: "When a man was arrested, interrogated, and confessed to kidnapping, the arresting officers neglected to inform him of his Fifth Amendment right not to self-incriminate. His appeal to the Supreme Court upon being found guilty resulted in a decision that the right to not incriminate oneself relies heavily a suspect being informed of these rights at the time of arrest. This ensures that any statements they provide are voluntary."
